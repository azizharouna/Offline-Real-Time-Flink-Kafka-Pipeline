# Kafka Offset Commit and Rebalance Explained

## 1. What is Offset Commit?

- **Offset commit** means saving the position (offset) of the last processed message by a consumer.
- It tells Kafka, "I have processed all messages up to this offset."
- This helps consumers resume processing after a restart or failure.

### Two types of commits

- **Automatic commit**: Kafka client commits offsets at intervals automatically (default every 5 seconds).
- **Manual commit**: The application commits offsets explicitly after processing messages.

---

## 2. Why is Offset Commit Important?

- Avoids **reprocessing** messages after consumer restart.
- Helps achieve **fault tolerance**.
- Controls the **processing guarantees** (at-least-once or exactly-once).

---

## 3. What is Rebalancing?

- Happens when consumers join or leave a consumer group.
- Kafka redistributes partitions among available consumers.
- Ensures load balancing and fault tolerance.

### When does rebalance happen?

- Consumer joins the group
- Consumer leaves or crashes
- Topic partitions change

---

## 4. Rebalance Process

- Kafka pauses consumption during rebalance.
- Partitions are reassigned.
- Consumers resume consumption on new assignments.

---

## 5. Problems Caused by Rebalance

- Temporary **message processing pause**.
- Possible **duplicate processing** if offsets are committed after message processing but before rebalance.
- If offset commit is not synchronized with processing, it can cause message loss or reprocessing.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use **manual offset commit** after successful message processing.
- Handle **rebalance listeners** to commit offsets before rebalance starts.
- Use frameworks like **Apache Flink** which manage offsets and rebalances smoothly.

---

## 7. Questions for Reflection

- What happens if a consumer crashes before committing the offset?  
- How does rebalance affect exactly-once processing guarantees?  
- How can you minimize processing delays during rebalance?  
- How do manual and automatic commits impact rebalance behavior?
